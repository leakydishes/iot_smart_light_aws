# Scalable Smart Lighting and Environmental Sustainability; IoT ESP32 Prototype Integrated with AWS Management

A project Internet of Things (IoTs) smart lighting prototype using AWS services (scalability) and ESP32 microcontroller. 

This project includes, Internet of Things (IoTs) smart lighting prototype using AWS services and ESP32 microcontroller. Additionally, research is undertaken to examine the significance of scalable IoT systems in urban cities and commercial spaces to highlight and resolve IoT industry challenges. The challenges in managing IoT scalability within an indoor environment is examined in the design implementation of the prototyped with additional aspirations to improve energy efficiency and safety. Secure data transmission to AWS IoT Core using MQTT from Arduino IDE (MQTT libraries) is used to collect environmental data from a ESP32 microcontroller. The ESP32 uses LDR (Light Depending Resistor) and PIR (passive infrared sensor) sensors to record environmental data while supporting energy efficiency (using timers). Amazon IoT services utilised for data collection and analyses include, IoT Core, Cloud Watch, Lambda, and DynamoDB. The report examines the challenges faced within the project (MKR1000 and ESP32 microcontrollers) and how technical issues were addressed.
